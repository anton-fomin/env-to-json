# Env to Json

Simple tool to dump env variables to json, potentially filtering by prefix and stripping it and also with ability to put this json into placeholder in existing file (which is useful to pass settings from environment variables in staticfiles builds). 

And since it made with rust it is of course blazingly fast! (without any proof though)
